# **AirLeap**
A real-time GraphQL server, implemented using Apollo Sever and Apollo Client.
Speecal allows user interface navigation through hand gestures and simple statements.
This project is designed to support navigation functionality aside from mouse and keyboard via motion sense and voice recognition. Functionality will include gestures and movement patterns programmed to be recognized as events that would otherwise be achieved with mouse and keyboard.

## **Prerequisites:**
  Leap motion device

## **Hardware and Software Requirements:**

The processor must be AMD Phenom™ II or Intel® Core™ i3/i5/i7 with 2 GB of RAM or more, USB 2.0 port, and an internet connection. The reason the operating system is needed is that the device is not fully compatible with Linux-based or other operating systems. The processor must be powerful enough to allow the website and devices to run properly. At least 2GB RAM is required because the website and Leap Motion device need at least that much memory to run smoothly. The USB 2.0 port is necessary to connect the leap motion device to the computer. The website will be tested off of a student’s laptop.
